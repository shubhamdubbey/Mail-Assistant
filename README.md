# AI-Powered Gmail Extension

This Chrome extension enhances Gmail by adding an **AI-powered assistant** to help you **compose or reply to emails faster and smarter**. Using this extension, users can:

- Generate professional, casual, friendly, formal, or straightforward email replies.
- Provide **additional instructions** to customize the tone and content of the email.
- Automatically insert AI-generated text directly into the Gmail compose window.
- Seamlessly work with both new emails and replies, ensuring context-aware responses.

## Overview

The extension injects a **dynamic AI button** into Gmail’s toolbar. When clicked, a **lightweight info box** appears, allowing users to select a tone, provide extra instructions, and generate email content. It handles both **new emails** (sending only tone and instructions) and **replies** (sending previous email content + additional instructions).

Below you can see how the application behaves step by step:
